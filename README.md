## üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites for users and devs:

- BakkesMod
- SOS Plugin


Download and install Bakkesmod from the official website. Bakkesmod is required to run custom broadcast overlays in Rocket League. 

[BakkesMod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/)



To install the SOS plugin in Rocket League:

Ensure Bakkesmod is installed, then download the sos-plugin.

[SOS Plugin](https://gitlab.com/bakkesplugins/sos/sos-plugin). 

The SOS plugin allows game data to be sent from Rocket League to the overlay via web socket connection.


Extract the downloaded SOS plugin files and place them in the appropriate folders within the Bakkesmod directory. 

sos.dll in x:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\plugins

sos.set in x:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\plugins\settings


After following these steps, the SOS plugin should be successfully installed and ready to use with Bakkesmod. Verify in the BakkesMod Menu by pressing
f2 and opening the pluginmanager. Ensure Simple Overlay System - SOS.dll is checked. You may need to relaunch Rocket League and/or BakkesMod.
