Install SOS Plugin Rocket League

To install the SOS plugin in Rocket League, you need to follow these steps:

Download and install Bakkesmod from the official website. Bakkesmod is required to run custom broadcast overlays in Rocket League.

Once Bakkesmod is installed, download the SOS plugin. The SOS plugin allows game data to be sent from Rocket League to the overlay via web socket connection.
Extract the downloaded SOS plugin files and place them in the appropriate folders within the Bakkesmod directory and set the Environment Variable.
After following these steps, the SOS plugin should be successfully installed and ready to use with Bakkesmod. Verify in the BakkesMod Menu by pressing
f2 and opening the pluginmanager. Ensure Simple Overlay System - SOS.dll is checked.

**// TEAM LOGOS //**

To input custom team logos, first ensure the logo is a .png. 
A transparent background is recommended. 

Once you have the properly formatted logo, place it in the /RLSSOverlayProject/TeamLogos directory. 

In the Control Panel, select "choose file" for the intended team, then select the file from the /TeamLogos directory, and the Overlay will update accordingly.
